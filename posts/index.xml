As the problem is embarrasingly parallel and explicitly needed by many particle physics experiments around the world, much work has been undertaken to exploit the RTX cores of modern NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate optical photon simulation and speaking directly to OptiX from the core Geant4 implementation of the detector geometry.</description></item><item><title>SWIFT-HEP workshop on 23-24 March 2022</title><link>/posts/2021-12-03-third-workshop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 12:02:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2021-12-03-third-workshop/</guid><description>The third SWIFT-HEP workshop will be held in Durham on 23-24 March.
