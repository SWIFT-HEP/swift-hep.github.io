Phase-1 saw the establishment of a team across multiple UK institutes, with about a dozen people 
funded for part of their time to work on cross-experiment software. The model proved to be 
successful as it allowed developers with different experiment interests to work together on 
common projects. At the same time, it was challenging to recruit a few new people to work on the 
project, which caused some delays for some of the work packages. 

The Phase-1.5 of the project has multiple purposes:
* We need to retain the staff we recruited to maintain the expertise that was created during 
Phase-1. Some of the staff are at the end of their contract and we need to ensure extensions are 
issued in the Autumn 2023, otherwise they will start looking for other opportunities. Other 
staff are part of research software engineering pools at university and will be redeployed to 
other projects if funding is not confirmed;
* The work conducted during Phase-1 can be extended and continued to achieve further 
deliverables; 
* The initial SoI submitted to Science Board in 2020 proposed a larger project to be developed 
at  the end of the first phase. A vision document for this Phase-2 was sent to STFC, and a full 
proposal is being developed;
* SWIFT-HEP started as a community-led project with a group of “conveners” that defined the 
scope  of the project. While we aim to maintain the community aspect of the project, we will 
also use  the next year to define a project delivery board that will be in charge of the project 
delivery  in Phase 1.5 and Phase 2.
