<h2> Science and strategy </h2>
Computing contributes significantly to the cost of operating HEP experiments, with the UK currently providing 
about 13.5% of the total ATLAS computing resources, 6% for CMS, 20% for LHCb and a significant fraction expected for DUNE. 
Resources are provided as a cross-experiment initiative via GridPP with a cost of about Â£5M/year. 
The overall resource requirement is expected to increase in the coming years as the experiment upgrades are designed to 
increase the overall data throughput by a factor of 10. 
Only a modest increase in resources is expected due to the diminishing growth rate at equal cost of computer processing and storage. <br>

At same time the evolution of computing hardware and software technologies calls for HEP software R&D. 
In particular the hardware has evolved towards parallel architectures where it is expected that the bulk of the arithmetic 
processing is performed using single instruction multiple process (SIMP) and single instruction multiple thread (SIMT). 
Optimising software to make use of this hardware is becoming the key to increase computing efficiency. 
Scientific computing is moving towards the use of accelerator hardware, such as GPUs and FPGAs, where thousands of 
threads operate simultaneously to perform fast scientific computations. 
This is an opportunity, as real-time applications such as low latency triggers can be 
developed using commodity hardware and software tools. At the same time GPUs are a promising technology with which to run simulation and data processing 
at lower cost and better power efficiency. To unlock these potential gains an aggressive software R&D programme is needed to modernise the current 
HEP codes and optimise their performance on the heterogeneous hardware architectures that are expected to be developed in the next decade. <br>

Such developments need to be sustainable, to last for the lifetime of the current experiments, to be open source, to allow for collaboration between different teams, 
and to follow industry standards, to exploit state-of-the-art training and enable collaboration with industry to access and inform the latest technologies. <br>

Establishing a software collaboration within HEP in the UK will ensure that future investments in HEP experiments will have access to the technology needed 
to exploit the data to maximise the physics return on investment. This will also create a core of knowledge and training in skills that 
are in high-demand in UK industry.


<h2> Timeline </h2>
This proposal covers this crucial 3 year period between April 2021 and March 2024 for the UK to participate and lead the development of the means to execute the next generation experiments.
The timeline for the SWIFT-HEP project is summarised in the figure below.

<h2> Work packages </h2>
The SWIFT-HEP work is organised in 5 work packages (WP), plus a management WP. A description and status of each WP is given in the dedicated pages:
<ul>
<li> WP0: Management
<li> WP1: Intelligent data and workflow management
</ul>
