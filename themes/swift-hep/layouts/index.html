            <h2>Overview</h2>
            To exploit the full physics potential offered by the large data sets collected by the next-generation experiments, new software and algorithmic techniques are required to handle their production rate, volume, and complexity. <br>
This need has led to an international roadmap for software development and the establishment of the HEP Software Foundation (<a href="https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/">HSF</a>) to address problems that are common across HEP experiments. <br>
SWIFT-HEP is a project funded by <a href="https://stfc.ukri.org/">STFC</a> as a UK contribution to the development of software for High Energy Physics experiments. <br>

            <h2> Activities </h2>
            SWIFT-HEP provides a platform for the community to interact on software development topics. <a href="{{ .Site.Home.Permalink }}/workshops/"> Workshops </a> are held twice a year, and 
            topical meetings are held on a monthly basis. See the <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/category/11790/">Indico category for full details</a>. <br><br>
            Training activities are also planned following the <a href="https://sidis.web.cern.ch/activities">SIDIS</a> curriculum.

            <h2>Organisation</h2>
            The SWIFT-HEP coordinator is <a href="mailto:davide.costanzo@cern.ch"> Davide Costanzo </a> (Sheffield) and deputy <a href="mailto:conor.fitzpatrick@cern.ch ">Conor Fitzpatrick</a> (Manchester). <br>
            Each work package has two conveners who meet every four weeks. <BR>
            An advisory board comprised by the UK spokespersons of the major HEP experiments oversees the activity of the project. <br>

            <h2> Vision for SWIFT-HEP </h2>
            SWIFT-HEP was exptended for 18 months starting in April 2024. The extension will 
allow the people working on the project to continue with their work. Details are <a

	    <br><br>
	    Beyond 2025, we expect to run a larger project SWIFT-HEP2 with an expanded list of 
work packages as summarised in a <a href="{{ .Site.Home.Permalink }}/visionphase2/"> vision
