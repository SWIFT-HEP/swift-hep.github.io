Progress The analysis work package is due to start on the 1st of April 2022. We are currently in the planning and hiring phase.
Collaboration with other HEP efforts Planned collaboration with the HSF and IRIS-HEP by contributing to the Analysis Grand Challenges in particular.

Both openings are within the particle physics group and will be constructed by two of the four areas below:
Development of efficient and fast software for particle physics in the context of the SWIFT-HEP initiative (with a focus on Python). Software development on highly parallel computing architectures for LHCb-upgrade II, with a focus on Graphcore’s novel IPU processors (C++ -based).</description></item><item><title>Organisation</title><link>https://swift-hep.github.io/organisation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 11:53:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swift-hep.github.io/organisation/</guid><description>Management The SWIFT-HEP coordinator is Davide Costanzo (Sheffield, ATLAS) and deputy Conor Fitzpatrick (Manchester, LHCb).

As the problem is embarrasingly parallel and explicitly needed by many particle physics experiments around the world, much work has been undertaken to exploit the RTX cores of modern NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate optical photon simulation and speaking directly to OptiX from the core Geant4 implementation of the detector geometry.</description></item><item><title>Overview</title><link>https://swift-hep.github.io/overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 20:43:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swift-hep.github.io/overview/</guid><description>Science and strategy Computing contributes significantly to the cost of operating HEP experiments, with the UK currently providing about 13.5% of the total ATLAS computing resources, 6% for CMS, 20% for LHCb and a significant fraction expected for DUNE. Resources are provided as a cross-experiment initiative via GridPP with a cost of about £5M/year. The overall resource requirement is expected to increase in the coming years as the experiment upgrades are designed to increase the overall data throughput by a factor of 10.</description></item><item><title>SWIFT-HEP workshop on 23-24 March 2022</title><link>https://swift-hep.github.io/posts/2021-12-03-third-workshop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 12:02:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swift-hep.github.io/posts/2021-12-03-third-workshop/</guid><description>The third SWIFT-HEP workshop will be held in Durham on 23-24 March.
